I am a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Chamapign advised by Prof. Ruoyu Sun with co-advisor Prof. Naira Hovakimyan. 

**Research interest:** neural network pruning; neural architecture search (NAS); deep generative models; graph neural networks (GNN); numerical methods.

## News

[**Jan. 2023**] Our paper about foresight pruning is accepted to ICLR 2023!

[**March. 2022**] Our paper about neural architecture search for meta learning is accpeted to CVPR 2022!
