I am a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Chamapign advised by [Prof. Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/) with co-advisor [Prof. Naira Hovakimyan](http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/). During the first year of my Ph.D., I worked with [Prof. Justin Sirignano](https://jasirign.github.io/) on deep learning for computational fluid mechanics (CFD).

**Research interest:** Efficient deep learning; Neural network pruning; Neural architecture search (NAS); Generative models; Graph neural networks (GNN); Numerical methods.

## News

[**Feb. 2023**] Our paper on dynamic sparse training for GANs is made public on arxiv!

[**Jan. 2023**] Our paper about foresight pruning is accepted to ICLR 2023!

[**March. 2022**] Our paper about neural architecture search for meta learning is accpeted to CVPR 2022!
