I am a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Chamapign advised by Prof. Ruoyu Sun with co-advisor Prof. Naira Hovakimyan. 



Research interest: neural network pruning; neural architecture search (NAS); generative models (GANs); graph neural networks (GNN).

#### News

[**Jan. 2023**] Our paper NTK-SAP is accepted to ICLR2023.

[**March. 2022**] Our paper Global Convergence of MAML and Theory-Inspired Neural Architecture Search for Few-Shot Learning is accpeted to CVPR2022.
